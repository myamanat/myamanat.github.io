                        <h2>SAYING MY PIECE</h2>
                        <p>
                            There's a mistake I continually make. As you may have read in my introductory bio at the front of this website, I tend to place a lot of value on language and intentional communication. I believe that in many cases, a problem can be solved by virtue of better information transfer, and language is the foundation for that. There has been many a time in my life when I have felt a tremendous hurt that I was adamant could be salved if I just had more words. If there was just a little more bandwidth. But like a highway that keeps getting more lanes built, more volume won't solve the problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've even made the argument to myself: I'm not asking for more words, I'm asking for better quality of communication. A more focused signal. I want to be able to lean on language, to not fall through the cracks between letters. Language is what will ultimately bring us together. Language is what will bring an end to my suffering. Language is intimacy, and language is desire. This is what I have been taught, and this is the message that's been repeated continually in my mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is false. Well, it's true, but it isn't true if you take it at face value. If language is just words, as I have been implying, then this is false. Words alone can't form bonds. Words are water. Water alone can't create life. It can come close. It can get you over halfway, but it can't create life. To create life, we must access the multimodality of language, while also making use of the temporal.</p>
                        <p>Language isn't just words. Language is food, language is touch, language is gaze, language is gays. Language is silence. It's not just about building webs of interconnected symbolic value. It's not just about tightly woven cloth. Language is the tearing of the thread. It's the ripping of the canvas. Language is letting go. Language is abandoning one thing, and finding another. Language is ineffable. Language is incomprehensible. Language is what's left out. I sound like I'm speaking in paradox, but I am not. Language tells you who what where why when how to what extent etc. It also tells you who not what not where not why not when not how not and to what extent not etc. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I find my home in language, not because it's easy, but because with it and without it, I am safe.
                        </p>

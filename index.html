                            <p>Hi! My name is Maya Amanat [pronouns: she/they]. I am a 3rd year at Oberlin College, majoring in Comparative Literature and minoring in Computer Science. My aim is to be part of an effort to create more balanced, ethical, and organic continuities between digital, social, and sensory ecologies. Computers have already enmeshed with the fabric of our lives, and this integration will only get deeper. I am looking to work at the intersection of product development and social impact, to collaboratively architect experiences that prioritize a userâ€™s health and wellbeing. I believe that language is an effective tool for doing this work, with a critical role in bridging divides and improving global efficiencies.</p>

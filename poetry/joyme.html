            <h1>joy etc. me</h1>
            <p>the next one will ask me where i buried the jewelry<br>
                take me in through the fence gate
            </p>
            <p>yeah, we'll strut between the wood grain<br>
                i am diving off the crucifix and into academia<br>                
            </p>
            <p>i am manifest, but you can call me #your shit#<br>
                as long as you swallow every morsel of your resolve                
            </p>
            <p>i was once your wisdom, after all:<br>
                it was i who taught you how love is success isn't me                
            </p>
            <p>garbled shrieks get slowly muffled by your avoidance of the truth<br>
                i would eagerly guide your thumb to each mark of dissonance                
            </p>
            <p>until finally, the air settles into its flatness, back to me in the dark<br>
                you can hear me                
            </p>
            <p>bringing the scratched dvd to fruition<br>
                repressing, no, repeating trauma every time a scene skips                
            </p>
            <p>
                bringing the lab to fruition<br>
                designing a salve in the form of a reverie
            </p>
            <p>
                bringing excuses to fruition<br>
                so you can't find me
            </p>
            <p>
                sprawled out on your floor<br>
                etching distance into every tile                 
            </p>
            <p>
                turning the ground into a treasure map<br>
                that you'll take one glance at before labeling it nonsense                 
            </p>
            <p>
                so tell me,<br>
                where <i>did</i> i bury the jewelry?
            </p>
            <p>
                you know i can't leave, can't leave, can't leave<br>
                i am (not) free floating like you                  
            </p>
            <p>
                i am NOT the break<br>
                i am emergence                 
            </p>
            <p>
                though it tears me up<br>
                inside
            </p>
            <p>when you turn to face your shadow,<br>
                i will be your joy
            </p>
